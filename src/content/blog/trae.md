[Trae](https://trae.ai) is one of the best VSCode forks I've ever seen. It's definitely a [Cursor](https://cursor.com) and a [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) killer, mainly because of its UI. The UI kind of looks like [Fleet](https://www.jetbrains.com/fleet/) but better.

<h3>Pros And Cons</h3>

Trae also has good and bad sides like any other IDEs.

Pros:

- Good UI
- AI integration (Sonnet & 4o)
- Fork of VSCode
- Built-in "Webview" option
- Terminal command `trae`, just like `code`

<br />

Cons:

- Doesn't support WSL
- Doesn't support theme extensions
- Doesn't "GitHub Codespaces"

<br />
