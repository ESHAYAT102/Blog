<h3>A Personal Retrospective</h3>

I've always been fascinated by technology, ever since I was a young child. My father had a computer, and I spent countless hours playing games in it. As I grew older, my interest shifted towards design. I found joy in creating visual interfaces, and tools like Figma, Framer, and Adobe Photoshop became my companions.

However, it wasn't until December 2022 that I truly delved into the world of coding. I started with Scratch, a visual programming language that made learning code fun and accessible. While it wasn't traditional coding, it laid a solid foundation for understanding programming concepts.

In September 2023, I took my first steps into Python. Although my journey was brief due to exams, it ignited a passion for writing code.

My real coding adventure began with W3Schools, where I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These languages are the building blocks of the web, and mastering them opened up a world of possibilities.

In February 2024, I joined Codingal, an online coding platform that provided structured learning and hands-on projects. Over the past few months, I've honed my skills and gained practical experience in web development.

Looking back, I'm amazed at how far I've come. From a curious child to a budding web developer, my journey has been filled with challenges and triumphs. I'm excited to continue learning and exploring the ever-evolving world of web development.

<h3>What's Next?</h3>

I'm eager to take on more complex projects and collaborate with other developers. I'm particularly interested in frontend development, as I love creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces. I'm also open to exploring backend development and full-stack development in the future.

I believe that with dedication and hard work, I can achieve my goals and make a significant contribution to the tech industry. I'm grateful for the opportunities that have come my way and the support of my friends and family.
